### Introduction
This a choropleth map of rural populations in Oregon counties. This choropleth was layed over the bing sattelite basemap then tiled using the QTiles plugin on QGIS. The resulting tiles were then layed ontop of the default grey openstreetmap baselayer.

### Zoom Levels
The zoom levels used for creating the tiles are 5 through 10. These zoom levels were chosen to accomodate viewing the entire state of Oregon as well as its counties.
